        <h3 id="truthOrLie">I recently became a dog dad.</h3>
        <p class="description">This is true. I adopted a Manchester Terrier 2 days ago. His name is Timber and he's 5 years old.
            He's adorable!</p>

        <h3 id="truthOrLie">I have played guitar for 14 years.</h3>
        <p class="description">This is false. I have played guitar for 13 years (3 years formal lessons, 10 years self-taught.)

             <div id="truthLieContainer">
                 <h3 id="truthOrLie">I have traveled to 6 countries.</h3>
                 <p class="description">This is technically true. I went on a vacation to Geneva, London, France, and Italy in 2016. We had a
                     layover in Canada but I stayed the night in Montreal to catch my connecting flight back home, so I count
                    that. Then in April of 2018 I went to Ensenada, Mexico on a home build trip with my dad.</p>
